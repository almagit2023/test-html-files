  <p>I was born in Raswada, a village in Rajasthan’s Alwar district. Including my parents, three sisters, and a brother,
    we
    were a family of seven. My parents were in search of better opportunities, and so we shifted to Gurugram, Haryana,
    when
    I was eight years old. I completed my schooling there and got married in 2001 at the age of 18.

    I now live with my husband, daughter, and son in Alwar. My husband is a daily wage worker—he whitewashes buildings
    and
    earns INR 600 per day. Soon after getting married, I realised I would have to work to meet our expenses—we lacked
    basic
    facilities such as water and proper sanitation.

    Very early in my life, I understood the need for women to create their own identity. I started with working at
    nonprofits, where I gave jeevan kaushal shiksha (life skills education) to teenage girls to help them learn critical
    thinking and problem solving in their everyday lives. I realised that to be able to continue in this line of work, I
    had
    to study more. So after nine years of marriage, I got a BA and a BEd degree. I am currently a field coordinator and
    trainer with Ibtada, a nonprofit based in Alwar. My work involves offering career counselling to young women,
    facilitating their computer education, and conducting sports programmes for them. I also work on Ibtada’s programme
    for
    newly married women where I teach them communication skills and make them aware of their nutritional needs,
    reproductive
    health, etc. I help them navigate patriarchal spaces too, and aid them in understanding the layered nature of
    gendered
    violence and ways to counter it. While my life has informed my work, my experience in the development sector has
    equally
    influenced my life.
